I use car to go to many places in the world. I use my laptop and computers to work on some homework i have. I use gaming console to play video games on the go. I like technology its pretty cool. I use air conditioner to change the temperature of my room to get cool. Light bulbs,  motorcycles,television these are just a few technology i use. Awesome right?</h2>
